The design phase deals with learning objectives, assessment instruments, exercises,
content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning, and media selection. The design
phase should be systematic and specific. Systematic means a logical, orderly method of
identifying, developing and evaluating a set of planned strategies targeted for
attaining the project's goals. Specific means each element of the instructional design plan must
be executed with attention to details.
